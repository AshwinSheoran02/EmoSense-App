**WHAT'S NEW?**

Songs are now recommended after a thorough sentimental analysis of the lyrics AND the audio features from Spotify.
The following audio features are used-['acousticness', 'danceability', 'energy', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'loudness', 'speechiness', 'valence', 'sentiment']
After recommending songs, they are also played using the pygame library.
After all are done playing, feedback is taken and f1-score is used as the main evaluation metric.
