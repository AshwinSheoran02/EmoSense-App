Mood taken as input and then spotify api is used to retrieve songs that match mood and retrieve artist and track names.
Each track is then fed to Genius API to extract lyrics of that and using vaderSentiment, we assign a sentiment score to each.
A new column is created in lyrics.csv that stores the sentiment score next to each track.
Calculate mean sentiment of returned tracks and based on that and user mood input, recommend ten best matching songs.
